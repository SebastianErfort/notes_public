## Tools & Software

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
  file.link AS "Name",
  desc-short AS "Description",
  (join(category)) AS "Category"
WHERE type = "software" AND contains(category,"markdown")
SORT title
```

## Features

There's a great number of cheatsheets and similar references for standard features, see the table at the beginning. The following only contains some additions and examples.

### Links

| Type                           | Description |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- |
| stand-alone URLs `https://...` |  should be inside `<...>` to be processed properly by some Markdown parsers |
| regular inline links `[link text](url "alt text")` | `alt text` is optional, some viewers render it as a tooltip, to handle special characters that would require escaping, such as spaces, some parsers allow URLs in `<...>` again |
| [Wiki-links] `[[url\|link text]]` | helpful extension in some parsers and can be used like `[[url\|link text]]`
| HTML `<a href="url" title="alt text">link text</a>` | helpful when using HTML as mixing with Markdown is not a good idea |

### Lists

Description lists are non-standard in Markdown and require HTML

```html
<dl>
<dt>Item</dt>
<dd>Description</dd>
</dl>
```

### Tables

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; width: 100%">
<div style="width: 45%">

```markdown
| Item | Price | # In stock |
|--------------|:-----:|-----------:|
| Juicy Apples | 1.99 | 739 |
| Bananas | 1.89 | 6 |
```

</div>
<div style="width: 45%">

| Item | Price | # In stock |
|--------------|:-----:|-----------:|
| Juicy Apples | 1.99 | 739 |
| Bananas | 1.89 | 6 |
</div>
</div>

- use `|` for columns (and vertical lines), `-` for rows and horizontal lines
- leading and closing `|` can be omitted (in some Markdown implementations?)
- use `:` for alignment

### Code blocks

[List of Markdown code block languages](https://markdown.land/markdown-code-block)

### Columns

Columns can be achieved with HTML, rendering is dependent on the reader/parser used though.

Two fixed-width columns
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; width: 100%">
<div style="width: 45%">
Column 1
</div>
<div style="width: 45%">
Column 2
</div>
</div>

### Custom CSS

Many Markdown viewers/parsers allow the inclusion of custom [[CSS]] code for styling. This can for example be used to set up classes with certain styles, to facilitate applying visual effects.


### (YAML) Front Matter

Many parsers support a block of metadata at the beginning of a Markdown file, usually written in [[dev/YAML|YAML]], sometimes in [[TOML]]. What keys are accepted/used by the parsers varies, but a lot of useful things can be achieved with this.

Example

```yaml
---
title: My Document
date: 2024-01-01
---
```
