## Tools

- [CernVM-FS](https://cernvm.cern.ch/fs/): [docs](https://cvmfs.readthedocs.io/) | [source](https://github.com/cvmfs/cvmfs)
  > The CernVM File System provides a scalable, reliable and low-maintenance software distribution service. It was developed to assist High Energy Physics (HEP) collaborations to deploy software on the worldwide-distributed computing infrastructure used to run data processing applications. CernVM-FS is implemented as a POSIX read-only file system in user space (a FUSE module). Files and directories are hosted on standard web servers and mounted in the universal namespace /cvmfs.
