  DocBook is a schema (available in several languages including RELAX NG, SGML and XML DTDs, and W3C XML Schema) maintained by the [DocBook Technical Committee](mailto:docbook-tc@oasis-open.org) of [OASIS](https://www.oasis-open.org/). It is particularly well suited to books and papers about computer hardware and software (though it is by no means limited to these applications).
