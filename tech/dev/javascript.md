## Package Managers

### npm

Node Package Manger (npm) is outdated and collecting tons of redundant packages in `node_modules/`, there's memes about it.

### pnpm

[pnpm website]

Doesn't even mention it's a <em>JavaScript</em> package manager. Man do I hope I'll never have to do JavaScript development.
