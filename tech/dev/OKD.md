desc: OKD is a very opinionated deployment of Kubernetes. Kubernetes is a collection of software and design patterns to operate applications at scale.We add some features directly as modifications into Kubernetes, but mostly we augment the platform by "preinstalling" a large amount of pieces of software called "Operators" into the deployed cluster.These operators then provide all of our cluster components (over 100 of them!) which make up the platform, such as OS upgrades, web consoles, monitoring and image building
