# pre-commit Framework

The [pre-commit framework](https://pre-commit.com) facilitates using and maintaining hooks. They can be downloaded e.g. from GitHub and re-used across projects.


## Examples

- [pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks @GH](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks)
- [[black#^13286c|Black code formatter: pre-commit hooks]]
- [CERN pre-commit hooks](https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb-core/pre-commit-hooks/): include in pipeline via HTTPS, run hooks, generate patch if code is changed that can be downloaded and applied locally
