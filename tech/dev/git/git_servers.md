| Pros                                              | Cons                                                                                                                                              |

| widely used, in some circles synonym with Git     | owned by Microsoft                                                                                                                                |
| collaboration features such as GitHub Discussions | some settings are unintuitive and clumsy, e.g. creating an access token                                                                           |
|                                                   | CI/CD seems convoluted and poorly documented in comparison to GitLab. *Actions* can be nice, but tend to be opaque and overwhelming if inspected. |
|                                                   | no way to structure repositories in trees, everything is a repository                                                                             |
|                                                   |                                                                                                                                                   |
