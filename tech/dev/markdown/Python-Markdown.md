  This is a Python implementation of John Gruber’s [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). It is almost completely compliant with the reference implementation, though there are a few very minor [differences](https://python-markdown.github.io/#differences). See John’s [Syntax Documentation](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for the syntax rules.
