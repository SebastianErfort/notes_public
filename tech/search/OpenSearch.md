desc-short: OpenSearch is a community-driven, open source fork of Elasticsearch and Kibana following the license change in early 2021. We're looking to sustain (and evolve!) a search and analytics suite for the multitude of businesses who are dependent on the rights granted by the original, Apache v2.0 License.
