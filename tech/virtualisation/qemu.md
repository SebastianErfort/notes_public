desc: QEMU (Quick Emulator[3]) is a free and open-source emulator. It emulates a computer's processor through dynamic binary translation and provides a set of different hardware and device models for the machine, enabling it to run a variety of guest operating systems. It can interoperate with Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) to run virtual machines at near-native speed. QEMU can also do emulation for user-level processes, allowing applications compiled for one architecture to run on another.[4]QEMU supports the emulation of various architectures, including x86, ARM, PowerPC, RISC-V, and others.
