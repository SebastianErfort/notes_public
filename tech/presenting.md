## Audience Interaction

- [Poll Everywhere](https://pollev.com/home): easily create polls
- [Strawpoll](https://strawpoll.com/): Create your poll in seconds
    - standard polls
    - schedule
    - advanced
    - comments
    - duplicate detection
      Seems to work better in [[revealjs]] presentations.

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
file.link AS "Name",
url AS "Website"
WHERE type = "software" AND contains(category, "present") OR contains(file.folder, "presenting")
```
