- RJ-45 (ethernet): 8 pins
- twisted pair: twisting counters antenna effect and thus signal interference
    - different categories with varying shielding and bandwidths (e.g. CAT5 or CAT6)
    - may have shielding, e.g. metal foil
- fibre optic
    - core and cladding made of different refraction index materials
    - single or multi mode (thicker, signal can travel at varying angles and transversal speed - *delay distortion*)
- plenum-rated: for HVAC systems, not releasing toxic fumes under heat
