## Wi-Fi 6

- IEEE 802.11n Wi-Fi 4, 802.11ac W-Fi 5, 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6
- released 2019, frequencies 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, maximum bandwidth 9.6 Gbps, 1024-QAM (10 bits with 1 waveform), 20, 40, 80 and 160 MHz channel widths (Wi-Fi 5 at 40 MHz), 8 upstream and downstream connections (5: 1 up, 4 down, 4: single only), transmission method OFDMA
- target wake time (TWT): schedule client to send and receive for lower latency and power savings
- BSS (basic service set) coloring: distinguishable signals on same channel
