desc-short: "Maven is a project development management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model: builds, dependency management, documentation creation, site publication, and distribution publication are all controlled from [the `pom.xml` declarative file](https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.9.1/maven-model/maven.html). Maven can be extended by [plugins](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/) to utilise a number of other development tools for reporting or the build process.\n"
