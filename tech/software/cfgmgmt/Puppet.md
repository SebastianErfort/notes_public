#### Dependencies

There are mutiple ways to declare dependencies between resources to ensure they are run in a certain order. With newer version Puppet should also adhere to the order in which resources are stated in the manifest. This can save code repetition if many resources depend on one resource or the other way around.

```Puppet
## direct sequential dependency
file { 'resource1': }
~> exec { 'resource2': }
## from earlier resource to later
file { 'resource1':
  notify => [Exec['resource2'], Service['resource3']],
}
exec { 'resource2': }
service { 'resource3': }
## from later resource to earlier
file { 'resource1': }
service { 'resource2':
  require => File['resource2'],
}
```

### Logging

Examples: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/16671685>
*Notify resource*

```puppet
notify { "My message: variable = $variable": }
```

<details><summary>Different Puppet log level functions</summary>

```puppet
node default {
  notice("try to run this script with -v and -d to see difference between log levels")
  notice("function documentation is available here: http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/function.html")
  notice("--------------------------------------------------------------------------")

  debug("this is debug. visible only with -d or --debug")
  info("this is info. visible only with -v or --verbose or -d or --debug")
  alert("this is alert. always visible")
  crit("this is crit. always visible")
  emerg("this is emerg. always visible")
  err("this is err. always visible")
  warning("and this is warning. always visible")
  notice("this is notice. always visible")
  #fail will break execution
  fail("this is fail. always visible. fail will break execution process")

}
```

### Strings

Operations can be performed on strings using Puppet's builtin functionalities. For example

- `strip`: trim whitespace left and right (including newline characters)
- `l/rstrip`: trim whitespace left __or__ right

Most of these also work within variable substitution `${var}`, such as `${var.strip}`.

## Data and variables: Facter and Hiera

[Hiera, data and Puppet code: your path to the right data decisions @Puppet blog](https://puppet.com/blog/hiera-data-and-puppet-code-your-path-right-data-decisions/)

### Facter

[Facter](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/facter.html) | [Custom facts](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/custom_facts.html)
Puppet uses Facter to collect various information on the system and provides them as "facts".
> Facter is Puppetâ€™s cross-platform system profiling library. It discovers and reports per-node facts, which are available in your Puppet manifests as variables.

- [Executing shell commands in facts](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/custom_facts.html#executing_shell_commands_in_facts)
- [Confining facts](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/custom_facts.html#configuring_facts-confining-facts): for example to certain OSs
- Facts can be created as well
- Facts can be specified as command line environment variables, for example

  ```bash
  FACTER_timeout=0 puppet agent -t
  ```

- determine value of fact and debug

  ```puppet
  puppet facts --verbose --debug <your_fact>
  ```

[Remco's Ruby tutorial including Puppet facts](file://edu/ruby/remco/programming-in-ruby/Ruby%20Session4.ipynb)

### Hiera

[Documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/hiera.html) | [Hiera config](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/hiera_config_yaml_5.html)
Hiera works like a pyramid and the higher up a data layer is, the higher its priority. At the top is usually node-level data, that can overwrite profile/role/lower data such as defaults.

- The main file for this is the file `hiera.yaml` in the base of the repository.
- Hierarchy between modules is usually set in a file `common.yaml`, in our case `data/99_config.yaml`.  The section `profile::config:` contains the different sets of `modules` to be used in our different profiles
    - `base`: comon to all profiles
    - ...
    - `server`: modules for servers
- The order of modules within one of these sets is important, if there are dependencies! For example the module `sshd` uses data from the module `mfa` and has thus to come after/below it
- on top of that we have the node-level files (`node.yaml`), in our case in the directory `data/00_hosts/host.yaml`, role-assignments by IP-ranges in `data/10_roles` as well as external node classifiers (ENCs) in a separate repository [lwp/puppet-enc](https://git.lwp.rug.nl/lwp/puppet-enc).


### External Node Classifiers (ENCs)

[Puppet documentation on ENCs](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/nodes_external.html)

### Lookup

Hiera data can be accesses through a "look-up", using the `lookup` function. A hiera data element in `moduleA.yaml` with content

```yaml
moduleA::config: value
```

for example can be accessed in module B through `lookup('moduleA::config.value')`, see the [Puppet documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/hiera_automatic.html#access_hash_array-elements_keysubkey_notation).

### Template files

[Documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.5/lang_template.html) | [EPP](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.5/lang_template_epp.html) | [ERB](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.5/lang_template_erb.html)
In a template file (within hiera/yaml) there are several ways

- `yaml` style: `aliased_key: "%{lookup('other_key.\"dotted.subkey\"')}"`
- `.erb` (ruby template) style: `scope['mfa::enable']`
- `.epp` (puppet template) style: `$mfa.enabl`

Mind when puppet does the variable substitution though. To use hiera data within a template that is stored in hiera data again one might have to use `@var`. Also there's a zoo of different ways to achieve the same here. Sometimes the syntax is `$array['key']`, in other contexts it might be `$array[key]` without ticks, etc.

### Examples

[[rug/lwp/Puppet/Puppet|Work notes LWP: Puppet]]

## Config

Change default environment (branch): edit `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf`

```ini
[main]
server = fqdn.puppet.master
ca_server = fqdn.puppet.ca

[agent]
environment = my_branch
```

## Documentation

Documentation of self-written modules can be automatically created if certain formats for comments and descriptions are used, see [Puppet Strings](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/puppet_strings.html).

Using [Puppet Strings](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/puppet_strings.html#available-strings-tags) it is possible to automatically create Markdown documentation: requires certain format for module headers, then run `puppet strings generate --format markdown`

## Modules, Puppet Forge

- [apt module](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/apt) | [Github](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apt)
- [debconf community module](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/stm/debconf)

## Testing

[Jacob on testing @GitLab Wiki](https://git.lwp.rug.nl/lwp/wiki/-/wikis/jacob/Testing-Procedure)

- linting and syntax
    - `puppet-lint`
        - [list of checks and how to ignore them](http://puppet-lint.com/checks/)
        - [control comments](http://puppet-lint.com/controlcomments/) can be used in the code to ignore problems, even give reasons
        - `puppet-lint --show-ignored`
        - `puppet-lint --fix`: fixes problems found by `puppet-lint`
        - can also be invoked by `rake lint`
    - `rake syntax`: syntax check Puppet manifests and templates
    - `puppet parser validate`
    - `yamllint`: syntax, validity and style check for YAML files

- `rake`: puppet module testing
    - list commands with `rake -T` (has to have Rakefile)
    - will ensure correct ruby gem versions, similar to/using(?) `bundle`

- unit and integration
    - `rspec-puppet`
        - install: `gem install rspec-puppet puppetlabs_spec_helper rspec-puppet-facts`
        - for modules/classes created with PDK all necessary files and a basic test file should exist
        - run in module base directory: `rspec spec/dir/module_name.rb`
        - should be run using `rake spec` as other puppet testing facilities
    - `beaker`: puppet tool running code on a VM (vagrant, Docker, etc.)
        - uses a nodeset (VMs) defined e.g. in [`modulename/spec/acceptance/nodesets/default.yml`](file:///home/erfort/edu/puppet/LL_Puppet_EssT/elk/spec/acceptance/nodesets/default.yml)
- acceptance and manual testing:
    - module-specific scripts
        - usually in `_module_/files/tests`, see e.g. `icaclient`
        - tests can be run by executing `/var/tests/run_tests`
    - `beaker`: puppet's own

- Puppet Development Kit (PDK)
    - `pdk new module` creates a new module in the style of puppet forge modules, that means a lot of stuff we don't need
    - `pdk new class` creates a new (empty) class as a template in `manifests/init.pp` and `spec/classes/bla_spec.rb`
    - creates a file `.travis.yaml` for building with CI service Travis
        - works only with Github public repositories in the free version
        - Travis will request permissions from Github and once set up provide a pipeline for testing similar to GitLab etc.
