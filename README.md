My personal notes on life, the universe and Markdown.

Best browsed using [[public/tech/productivity/Obsidian/Obsidian|Obsidian Markdown editor/reader]] with plugin [[Dataview|Obsidian DataView]] for things to render properly, else you might see a lot of gibberish like <code>`=this.title`</code>.[^1]
